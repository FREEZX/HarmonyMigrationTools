# HarmonyMigrationTools
 **Harmony Migration Tools** is a library of tools and namespaces meant to provide a base layer of compatibility for C# programmers, particularly Unity programmers, looking to port their projects to the Flax Engine.

 The goal is NOT to change the manner in which users interact with Flax to fit their original engine's conventions, but to provide basic support that can be optimized and refactored out of the project as the project adapts to its new engine.  Many functions in this library will be slower than their Unity equivalents and should only be used for testing purposes.


 #### Scripting

 This project is still in the early stages of development and contributions are welcome.

 Use the namespace `HarmonyMigrationTools` to access scripting compatibility functions.

 #### Assets
 More to be determined soon.
